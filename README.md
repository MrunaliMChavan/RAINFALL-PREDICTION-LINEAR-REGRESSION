# RAINFALL-PREDICTION-LINEAR-REGRESSION

This project focuses on predicting precipitation levels based on weather data collected from Austin, Texas. It begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, converting non-numeric data to numeric, and dropping irrelevant columns. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution of precipitation across different months and visualize the relationship between month and precipitation. 

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a linear regression model is trained to predict precipitation levels. Evaluation metrics such as R-squared score, mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error are calculated to assess the model's performance. Skewness of numeric columns is also analyzed, and skewed distributions are visualized. Finally, a Ridge regression model is tuned to prevent overfitting, and its performance is evaluated using R-squared score. 

Overall, the project aims to provide insights into precipitation patterns and develop a predictive model for precipitation levels based on weather attributes.
