# RAINFALL-PREDICTION-LINEAR-REGRESSION
This project analyzes Austin weather data to predict precipitation levels. It preprocesses data, conducts EDA, trains a linear regression model, evaluates performance metrics, handles skewness, and tunes a Ridge regression model to prevent overfitting. The goal is to understand precipitation patterns and develop an accurate predictive model.
